📦 Dependencies
This project relies on the following dependencies:

⚡️gsap
⚡️scroltrigger
⚡️web cache


Make sure to study them before running the project. I also add a switch to load the lightest supported image format between webp and avif (thanks Edge), but for also browsers the avif solution should be enough.. sothe average code should be even smaller.
The icing on the cake is the web cache which should store the images for a better experience.
